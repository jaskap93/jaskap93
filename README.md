- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Jim Kapanka -- @jaskap93
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in the intersection of systems engineering and software architecture.
-      Defining and documenting the liminal spaces between embedded systems to provide robust pathways for data and logic from source to destination
-      and all the processing, buffering, marshalling, and protocol translations along the way!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning the Gherkin and Cucumber framework for verifiable functional requirements that
-      efficiently incorporate user expectations into executable requirements for direct implementation into source code.
